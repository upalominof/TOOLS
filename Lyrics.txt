Play me Old King Cole
That I may join with you
All your hearts now seem so far from me
It hardly seems to matter now

And the nurse will tell you lies 
Of a kingdom beyond the skies
But I am lost within this half-world
It hardly seems to matter now

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song
Here it comes again

Just a little bit
Just a little bit more time
Time left to live out my life

Play me my song
Here it comes again
Play me my song
Here it comes again

Old King Cole was a merry old soul
And a merry old soul was he
So he called for his pipe
And he called for his bowl
And he called for his fiddlers three

But the clock, tick-tock
On the mantlepiece
And I want, and I feel, and I know, and I touch
The walls

She's a lady, she's got time
Brush back your hair and let me get to know your face
She's a lady, she is mine
Oh, brush back your hair and let me get to know your flesh
I've been waiting here for so long 
And all this time that passed me by 
It doesn't seem to matter now 
You stand there with your fixed expression 
Casting doubt on all I have to say
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Why don't you touch me, touch me
Touch me now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now
Now, now, now, now

Creeping up the blind side
Shinning up the wall
Stealing through the dark of night
Climbing through a window
Stepping to the floor
Checking to the left and the right
Picking up the pieces
Putting them away
Something doesn't feel quite right

Help me someone, let me out of here
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Coming out of the woodwork
Through the open door
Pushing from above and below
Shadows but no substance
In the shape of men
Round and down and sideways they go
Adrift without direction
Eyes that hold despair
Then as one they sign and they moan

Help us someone, let us out of here
Living here so long, undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea
:
Sit down, sit down, sit down
Sit, down, sit down
As we relive our lives 
In what we tell you

Images of sorrow, pictures of delight
Things that go to make up a life
Endless days of summer
Longer nights of gloom
Waiting for the morning light
Scenes of unimportance
Photos in a frame
Things that go to make up a life

Help us someone, let us out of here
'Cause living here so long undisturbed
Dreaming of the time we were free
So many years ago
Before the time when we first heard
Welcome to the home by the sea

Let us relive our lives
In what we tell you

Sit down, sit down, sit down
'Cause you won't get away
No, with us you will stay
For the rest of your days, sit down
As we relive our lives 
In what we tell you
Let us relive our lives
In what we tell you

Everything was wonderful when you were in my life.
Yesterday we were on a roll, baby, then we end up in a fight.
Everywhere I look, I see problems, where I never seen before.
The cracks in the sidewalk, when I get home my key don't even fit the door.

The moon don't shine, it's broken down.
The clouds are crying, they're broken down.
The car won't start, it's broken down.
And this shattered heart, it's broken down.
My whole damn world, it's broken down.
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.

Stepped outside into the night, I took a walk around the block.
I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was locked.
So I came back home, feeling so alone, a light had burned out in the hall.
My TV is broke, said I'm out of smoke, there's no one I can even call.

The moon don't shine, it's broken down.
The clouds are crying, they're broken down.
The car won't start, it's broken down.
And this shattered heart, it's broken down.
My whole damn world, it's broken down.
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.
Said my whole damn world, it's broken down.
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.

Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.

I mean my whole damn world, it's broken down.
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.
My whole damn world, it's broken down.
Since you left me girl, it's broken down
